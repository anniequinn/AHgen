Description: AHgen is a software code, created in R. It is for anyone who needs to generate, analyse, and compare five-level hierarchical networks called “Abstraction Hierarchies".
    AHgen was developed to compare Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) scenarios for UK cities as part of the Water Resilient Cities project (EPSRC EP/N030419/1), using outputs from OSMtidy (V0.0.6; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7957953). 
    Additionally, its underlying functions may be adapted to analyse Abstraction Hierarchies in any domain or at any scale.
