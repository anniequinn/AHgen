AHgen is a software code written in R. It is designed to generate, analyse, and compare five-level hierarchical networks called “Abstraction Hierarchies”. The AHgen was developed to compare Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy models (USAH) for UK cities as part of the Water Resilient Cities project (EPSRC EP/N030419/1), using outputs from OSMtidy (V0.0.4; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3941990). Additionally, its underlying functions may be adapted to analyse Abstraction Hierarchies in any domain or at any scale.
