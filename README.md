AHgen is a software code, created in R. It is for anyone who needs to generate, analyse, compare, and visualise five-level hierarchical networks called â€œAbstraction Hierarchies". AHgen was developed to compare Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) scenarios for UK cities as part of the Water Resilient Cities project (EPSRC EP/N030419/1), using outputs from OSMtidy (V0.0.6; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7957953). 

Additionally, its underlying functions may be adapted to analyse Abstraction Hierarchies in any domain or at any scale.
